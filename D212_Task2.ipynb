    "## Part I: Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "### A.  Describe the purpose of this data mining report by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Propose one question relevant to a real-world organizational situation that you will answer by using principal component analysis (PCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  Define one goal of the data analysis. Ensure that your goal is reasonable within the scope of the scenario and is represented in the available data.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part II: Method Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "### B.  Explain the reasons for using PCA by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Explain how PCA analyzes the selected data set. Include expected outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  Summarize one assumption of PCA.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part III: Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "### C.  Perform data preparation for the chosen dataset by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Identify the continuous dataset variables that you will need in order to answer the PCA question proposed in part A1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  Standardize the continuous dataset variables identified in part C1. Include a copy of the cleaned dataset.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part IV: Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### D.  Perform PCA by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Determine the matrix of all the principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  Identify the total number of principal components using the elbow rule or the Kaiser criterion. Include a screenshot of the scree plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.  Identify the variance of each of the principal components identified in part D2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.  Identify the total variance captured by the principal components identified in part D2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.  Summarize the results of your data analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part V: Attachments\n",
    "\n",
    "### E.  Record the web sources used to acquire data or segments of third-party code to support the analysis. Ensure the web sources are reliable.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### F.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### G.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission."
