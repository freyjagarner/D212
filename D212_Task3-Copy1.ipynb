    "## Part I: Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "### A.  Describe the purpose of this data mining report by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Propose one question relevant to a real-world organizational situation that you will answer using market basket analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we identify the relationship between the purchase of certain items and other items from our dataset of customer transactions in order to use this data to reccommend items to customers based on current purchases?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  Define one goal of the data analysis. Ensure that your goal is reasonable within the scope of the scenario and is represented in the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis will be to identify the relationship between the items a customer purchases to see if there is a greater chance of them purchasing one item based on another. The purpose of this will be to use to properly pair, market and reccommend items based on a customers current purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part II: Market Basket Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "### B.  Explain the reasons for using market basket analysis by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Explain how market basket analyzes the selected dataset. Include expected outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market basket analysis looks at the frequency of items being purchased together to try to identify a relationship between the items. \n",
    "\n",
    "The expected outcome of this analysis will be:\n",
    "* The **antecedent** which is the initial purchase\n",
    "* The **consequent** which is the item purchased as a result of the first purchase\n",
    "* The **support** which is the ratio of transactions which contain an item or items.\n",
    "* The **confidence** which is the ratio of the support of an item or items to the support of an item or items.\n",
    "* The **lift** which is the ratio of the transactions containing an item or items to the item or items if they were random and independent, or the ration of the true to expected confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  Provide one example of transactions in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first transaction in the dataset is:\n",

    "#### 3.  Summarize one assumption of market basket analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    "Market basket analysis relies on there being a frequent relationship between items which are purchased together. If no items are purchased together frequently enough, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the analysis.\n",

    "#### 1.  Transform the dataset to make it suitable for market basket analysis. Include a copy of the cleaned dataset."
