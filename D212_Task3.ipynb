    "## Part I: Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "### A.  Describe the purpose of this data mining report by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Propose one question relevant to a real-world organizational situation that you will answer using market basket analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  Define one goal of the data analysis. Ensure that your goal is reasonable within the scope of the scenario and is represented in the available data.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part II: Market Basket Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "### B.  Explain the reasons for using market basket analysis by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Explain how market basket analyzes the selected dataset. Include expected outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  Provide one example of transactions in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.  Summarize one assumption of market basket analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part III: Data Preparation and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### C.  Prepare and perform market basket analysis by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Transform the dataset to make it suitable for market basket analysis. Include a copy of the cleaned dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  Execute the code used to generate association rules with the Apriori algorithm. Provide screenshots that demonstrate the error-free functionality of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.  Provide values for the support, lift, and confidence of the association rules table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.  Identify the top three rules generated by the Apriori algorithm. Include a screenshot of the top rules along with their summaries.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part IV: Data Summary and Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "### D.  Summarize your data analysis by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Summarize the significance of support, lift, and confidence from the results of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  Discuss the practical significance of the findings from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.  Recommend a course of action for the real-world organizational situation from part A1 based on your results from part D1.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part V: Attachments\n",
    "\n",
    "### E.  Provide a Panopto video recording that includes a demonstration of the functionality of the code used for the analysis and a summary of the programming environment.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The audiovisual recording should feature you visibly presenting the material (i.e., not in voiceover or embedded video) and should simultaneously capture both you and your multimedia presentation.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For instructions on how to access and use Panopto, use the \"Panopto How-To Videos\" web link provided below. To access Panopto's website, navigate to the web link titled \"Panopto Access,\" and then choose to log in using the “WGU” option. If prompted, log in using your WGU student portal credentials, and then it will forward you to Panopto’s website.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "To submit your recording, upload it to the Panopto drop box titled “Data Mining I – NVM2.” Once the recording has been uploaded and processed in Panopto's system, retrieve the URL of the recording from Panopto and copy and paste it into the Links option. Upload the remaining task requirements using the Attachments option.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### F.  Record all web sources used to acquire data or segments of third-party code to support the application. Ensure the web sources are reliable.\n",
